# BrainDrain
# Introduction
This app is partially based off of Adam Savage's game from the MythBusters episode "Laws of Attraction".  I made this app because I found the Stroop Effect intriguing and wanted to have my own portable version of the effect to test on my friends.  I made the app using Java, libGDX, and Eclipse IDE.

# Basic Overview
Upon starting the app, the user is greeted with a random colored text with the text saying a color's name other than the color it is.  The app waits a couple of seconds and generates a new color/color string combo.  There is no interaction with the app, the users simply shout out the color of the text or the color that the text spells out.
